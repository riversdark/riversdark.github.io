> He conocido lo que ignoran los griegos: la incertidumbre. (La lotería en Babilonia, Jorge Luis Borges)

The name of the blog, Lottery of Babylonian variations, is an (intended) variation of the title of a short story from Borges, _The lottery in Babylon_. As Borges and Deleuze often argued, life is all about repetition and variation. And the same is certainly true for probabilities. It's a story about chance, uncertainty, and a mechanism that started as a fool's play, but evolved, little by little, into a society, a religion, and ultimately the whole universe. It seemed to be quite well suited here.

This blog is mostly about deep learning and statistical modeling, especially from a Bayesian perspective., so that's likely what you are going to find here.

But you may also find some of my other sundry ruminations here.

On this blog I write in Chinese, which is my native language; and English, which I'm reasonably comfortable with; and French, which I'm reasonably uncomfortable with. I'm also learning Spanish and German.
