Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a class of mathematical models that describe the evolution of a random process over time. They are widely used in finance, physics, and other fields. Recently, they are often used in diffusion generative models, to simulate the continuous noising and denoising process.

In this post we review the basics of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how to draw samples to visualize them, and how to do inference when an observation is available. SDEs are an extremely rich subject, so this post is only meant to cover the basics in one dimension. Throughout this post we'll use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as an example model.
