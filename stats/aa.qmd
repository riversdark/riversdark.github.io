## Introduction

this is a blog post, introduce multiple sequence alignment for amino acid sequences using HMM model. 

the MSA result is then used as input for a Potts model, which predicts the contact map between amino acids. 


## Alignment of Amino Acid Sequences

introduce the HMM model

the underlying rationale for using HMM for amino acid sequence alignment

## Contact map prediction 

introduce the Potts model

the underlying rationale for using Potts model for contact map prediction

## Conclusion
